# SN 2020ano Light Curve Cleaning and Averaging

Filter: o-band
Discovery date: 58871.465
Number of control light curves: 8

## Uncertainty cut
Total percent of data flagged (0x2): 2.94%

## True uncertainties estimation
We increase the typical uncertainties from 22.00 to 32.89 by adding an additional systematic uncertainty of 24.45 in quadrature
The extra noise was added to the uncertainties of the SN light curve and copied to the "duJy_new" column

## Control light curve cut
Percent of data above x2_max bound (0x100): 2.68%
Percent of data above stn_max bound (0x200): 1.62%
Percent of data above Nclip_max bound (0x400): 0.98%
Percent of data below Ngood_min bound (0x800): 12.99%
Total percent of data flagged as questionable (not masked with control light curve flags but Nclip > 0) (0x80000): 16.61%
Total percent of data flagged as bad (0x400000): 15.89%

## ATLAS template change correction
Corrective flux 0.15 uJy added to first region
Corrective flux 4.94 uJy added to third region
Corrective flux -24.27 uJy added to global region

## Averaging cleaned light curves
Total percent of binned data flagged (0x800000): 3.99%.
