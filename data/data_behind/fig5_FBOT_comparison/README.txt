DESCRIPTION OF THE DATA

In Figure 5, we plot the time above half-maximum light vs absolute magnitude of the peak of the first peak,
taken from the best-fit lightning bolt model for each object. 
The pale gray markers in the background are taken from A. Y. Q. Ho, et al., 2023 (DOI:10.3847/1538-4357/acc533)
and will not be included here as they were already published. 

The data are included in the file: SNe_IIb_t-half_abs_mag.csv

Note that six supernova do not have any data along the rise to the SCE peak in the g+c bands, so we
use their r+o data instead: 2020ano, 2021heh, 2021pb, 2022hnt, 2022jpx, 2022qzr. These objects will have no
data under the time/absolute magnitude/errors columns in the g-band in the data file. 
These objects are indicated in the figure by the smaller square markers outlined in red.
